<h1>Instructions for prospective students</h1>
<div></div>
<font color="black" face="Verdana" size="4.8">
<div> Thank you for your interest in working with me. Note that sending emails is not needed to apply for graduate programs, as long as you indicate me as your potential supervisor in the application system. But, if you decide to send an email, please carefully read this instruction before sending an email. I'll only respond to an email that shows a good interest in my research and won't respond to broadcasting emails that do not mention how my research overlaps with your research interest.  <br><br></div>
<div><u><b><big>All prospective students</big></b></u></div>
<div><br></div>
<div> <ul><li> Read a few papers of mine that overlap with your research interest. Your email should be tailored to clearly show your interest in my research. Mention potential topics that you and I may have interest in. You may choose one of my current research projects or any cyber security-related topics that you envision we can work together. Mentioning all possible keywords in my homepage does not mean that you show your interest. You need to specifically mention why you feel my idea is interesting and why you want to work with me. </li> <br>
<li> Attach your CV, transcript, English score if English is not your first language, a statement of purpose (SoP) that includes a description of your representative projects and your roles in each project. SoP should also include your proposed topics and ideas. Don't compress them and attach them individually. Do not share your google drive or such kinds for your documents. Please attach your documents in the email. </li><br>
<li>If you have any publication, feel free to attach one of your representative publications. PhD applicants should have at least one publication and should attach the paper.</li>
<br>
<li>Minimum requirements for graduate students are at least basic knowledge about machine learning and an ability to develop machine learning models using any programming languages such as python or Java. If you have any github repository that can showcase your past projects, you may include the link in your CV. </li>
<br>
<li>If you have experiences/projects relevant to cyber security, please focus on those experiences for a statement. If you don't have, it would be good to mention how your skills can be used for cyber security research. </li>
<br>
<li>The admission committee makes the admission decision for Master students and PhD students are admitted directly by a supervisor. In Canada, you typically need a Master degree to do PhD. We have only one intake per year in the Fall term. We do not admit in Winter, Spring or Summer terms. For details, please refer to our department websites. I do not have a right to accept your application for graduate programs after an application deadline. </li>
</ul>
